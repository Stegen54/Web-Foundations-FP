# My Portfolio Website 

This is a simple responsive portfolio website template that I made for Repl.it template jam. You can use it and make it yours by changing things and colors to your style and liking! I made it with a lot of hard work, love and of course with code :) I'm not a professional coder, but i tried my best to make it look cool and yet still keep it simple. While working with JS i got many errors. Also thanks to all people on who i worked on this together with,Teslim,Teresa and Quawiyyah,they're amazing teammates.

## I have used:
+ **HTML5** for markup
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling 
+ Bit of **JavaScript** to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices 
+ **Font Awesome** for Icons
